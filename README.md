# Find-Digits
This C# program counts how many digits of a number evenly divide the number itself. The `findDigits` function converts the number `n` to a string, iterates through each digit, and increments a count if the digit is nonzero and divides `n` without a remainder. The `Main` method reads multiple test cases, calls the function for each, and outputs the results.
